# Elementary

1.   	Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.
2.   	Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
3.   	Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
4.   	Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
5.   	Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
6.   	Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.
7.   	Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
8.   	Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)
9.   	Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
10.   	Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.
11.   	Write a program to perform input/output of all basic data types.
12.   	Write a C program to enter two numbers and find their sum.
13.   	Write a C program to enter length and breadth of a rectangle and find its perimeter.
14.   	Write a C program to enter length and breadth of a rectangle and find its area.
15.   	Write a C program to find power of any number x ^ y.
16.   	Write a C program to enter any number and calculate its square root.
17.   	Write a C program to enter two angles of a triangle and find the third angle.
18.   	Write a C program to enter marks of five subjects and calculate total, average and percentage.
19.   	Write a C program to enter P, T, R and calculate Simple Interest.	
20.   	Write a C program to enter P, T, R and calculate Compound Interest.
21.     Write a C++ program that will convert a descimal number to binary.
